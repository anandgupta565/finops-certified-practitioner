### Teams need to Collaborate


### A Centralized team drives FinOps
* A entralized discount buying process removes rate negotiations from engineering team considerations
* Centrally govern and control Committed Use Discounts, Reserved Instances, and Volume/Custom with Cloud Providers 

### Everyone takes Ownership for their cloud usage


### Decisions are *driven by business Value of cloud*
* Cloud has been commonly looked to a 'Cost Center'
* With FinOps we look at the cloud as a *business value creator* 
* One of the main roles of FinOps is to maximize the value of the cloud spending
* FinOps is about making money 
* Cloud spend can drive more revenue, signal customer base growth, enable more product and feature release velocity, or even help shut down a data center

### Take advantage of the Variable cost model of the cloud.


### FinOps data should be Accessible and timely
