## Finance & Accounting Terminology

### Amortization
* Amortization is a financial term that generally refers to the process of gradually reducing a debt over a specific period of time through regular payments. 
* These payments typically consist of both principal (the original amount of debt) and interest.


### Fixed Cost
* In finance operations (FinOps), a fixed cost is a cost that does not change with the level of output or production. 
* These costs are incurred regardless of whether a business is producing anything or how much it is producing. 
* They are "fixed" in the sense that they are consistent and do not fluctuate with business activity.

## Technology Business Management and FinOps

### Technology Business Management (TBM) 
* Technology Business Management (TBM) is a discipline that improves business outcomes by giving organizations a consistent way to translate technology investments to business value by defining the tools, processes, data, and people needed to manage the business of technology 
    * FinOps is focused on results much more frequently than with TBM. 
    * TBM is monthly or quarterly focused whereas FinOps collects and reviews data constantly.

### Chargeback
* A chargeback in the context of finance operations (FinOps) is essentially a cost allocation method. 
* It's a way of redistributing costs within an organization to the departments or units that actually use the services or resources.
* Chargebacks offer departmental visibility into IT resource usage and also *charge* departments for their use

## Showback
* In finance operations (FinOps), showback is a method of demonstrating or "showing back" to departments within a company the costs associated with their usage of a service or resource. 
* The showback model is similar to the chargeback model I described earlier, but with one key difference: 
    * while a chargeback model involves actually billing departments for their usage
    * a showback model only reports on the costs without necessarily requiring payment
* Showbacks offer departmental visibility into IT resource usage *without charging* departments for their use.

## Unit Economics

### Shared Cost
* Shared costs, also known as shared services or overhead costs, in the context of finance operations (FinOps)
* Refer to costs that are incurred for the common benefit of multiple departments or units within a company
* These costs aren't directly attributable to any one department or product but are necessary for the overall operation of the business
* There are typically three ways to split up shared costs:
    * Proportional: Based on relative percentage of direct costs
    * Even split: Split total amount evenly across targets
    * Fixed: User-defined coefficient (the sum of coefficients needs to be 100%)
